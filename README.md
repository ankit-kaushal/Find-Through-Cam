# Find Through Cam
## Getting started with idea:
An application which can be used to find people and any object which goes missing. If missing person or object comes in contact with camera our Program will notify.
## How we plan to approach the problem:
Many times it happens that if any person goes missing. We start searching him/her but we donâ€™t know where to search and in which direction. Also FIR can be lodged after 24 hours of missing. So to tackle this problem we have developed a website where details of the missing person could be registered. After that authorities would get a notification that someone is missing from such and such location. The authority will then put the image of the missing person in the database folder. After that, they will run our program. As soon as that missing person comes in contact with the camera(CCTV camera) our program will notify the authorities with a sound. So in this way a missing person could be found without much problem and delay.

Also sometimes when we go to any place like airport, railway station or any fair.  We forget our personal things/luggage somewhere and after that we cannot remember where we lost it. So, for searching any missing object just the owner of the missing object need to report to officials and the officials will put an image(or similar image) of that missing object. So, while searching if that object comes under the camera, the authorities will get notified. (Here, drone camera can be used to find missing things/luggage)
